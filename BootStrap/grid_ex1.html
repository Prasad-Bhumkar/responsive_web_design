                </h3>

                If you're looking for random paragraphs, you've come to the right place. When a random word or a random
                sentence isn't quite enough, the next logical step is to find a random paragraph. We created the Random
                Paragraph Generator with you in mind. The process is quite simple. Choose the number of random
                paragraphs you'd like to see and click the button. Your chosen number of paragraphs will instantly
                appear.

            </div>
            <div class="col-4">
                <p>
                <h3>
                    this is paragraph 2.
                </h3>

                Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative flow going at the
                beginning of the day. The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about when it
                appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common writing challenges.
