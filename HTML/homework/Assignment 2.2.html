            It is common for C++ programs to include many built-in elements from the standard C++ library, including <u>classes, keywords, constants, operators,</u> etc. It is necessary to include an appropriate header file in a program in order to use such pre-defined elements.
            In the above program, <u>#include</u> was the line put to include the header file iostream.  The iostream library helps us to get input data and show output data. The iostream library also has many more uses and error facilities; it is not only limited to input and output.
